## Usage

### Create from a GitHub template

Add the [top of this page on GitHub](https://github.com/123ishaTest/ts-library-template) there should be a large green button that says `Use This Template`.
Click that to use this template!

### Change these things in the project

- [ ] Update the `package.json`.
  - [ ] Update the package `name` and `description`.
  - [ ] Replace anything that says `ts-library-template` with your package name.
  - [ ] Replace anything with that says `isha` with your name and contact details.
- [ ] Add an environment variable `NPM_TOKEN` to GitHub actions, [so it can publish packages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages#publishing-packages-to-the-npm-registry)
- [ ] Update the README.
- [ ] Inspect the `.github/workflows` configuration to see if they work with your GitHub setup.
- [ ] Update your Prettier settings and don't complain about my preferences :)
- [ ] Make something cool!
